== OpenTemplot Object Model

This document describes the internal object model to be used by OpenTemplot. 
Note that this is not the *current* structure, but is rather what we are 
intending to move towards.

The first objective is to achieve a clear separation between Model classes and 
Presentation/UI classes. Model classes will be unit tested, and compilable without
referencing any Form or UI code.

This first diagram shows the top-level model classes:

[plantuml, diagram-classes, png]
....
class Tbox
abstract class Ttemplate
class Tturnout
class Tplain_track
class Thalf_diamond
class Tdummy_vehicle

Tbox *- "*" Ttemplate
Ttemplate <|-- Tturnout
Ttemplate <|-- Tplain_track
Ttemplate <|-- Thalf_diamond
Tbox *-- "*" Tdummy_vehicle
....
